Here we have a game called Mega Sena (2 to 3 times per week, 6 numbers drawn from 1 to 60)


The algorithm should provide 20 (or 50) sequences of 6 most probable numbers based on the calculation

Use the database of all Mega Sena contests since the beginning (2884 contests)

Create a new database with 3 columns: contest number, contest date, drawn numbers

Search for particularities, similarities, and coincidences between results, dates, and contest numbers

Example: contest 2354 (02/10/2024 → numbers: 32, 35, 20, 08, 44, 15)

32 is in the date (inverse of 23)

35 is in the date

20 as well

08 is the sum of 5+3

44 is 20+24

15 is 3x5

The algorithm should use fundamental operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) between the date and the contest number

Needs training with the entire database

Use statistics, data science, ML and deep learning (hybrid)

Eliminate database rows where there is no mathematical relation between date, number, and drawn numbers

Also consider numbers read both ways (right ↔ left)

The output must be 50 games with no repetition of combinations

The inputs (date and number) serve to generate mathematical combinations and predict new numbers

The final algorithm must predict 6-number results for future contests
